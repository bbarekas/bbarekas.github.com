  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>My name is Bill Barekas, I am an experienced software engineer. I
      live in Patras, Greece. This site is my little space on web to write
      anything I want to write. I use Github Pages to host this and Jekyll to
      edit my blog. I have big plans for this site but not much time to do
      them. My little son get all my free time when I am at home.
  </p>
  <p>One of the things I want to do is to maintain a personal blog, writing
      about my activities mainly the non-computerized ones. I like to share
      experiences from things I do, places I visit and some usual useless
      information that might be interesting for someone.

  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>My name is Bill Barekas, I am an experienced software engineer. I
      live in Patras, Greece. This site is my little space on web to write
      anything I want to write. I use Github Pages to host this and Jekyll to
      edit my blog. I have big plans for this site but not much time to do
      them. My little son get all my free time when ever I am at home.

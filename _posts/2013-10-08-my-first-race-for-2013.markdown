Last Sunday I ran my first running race for 2013. I had planned to run
this race during spring when I have heard about
<a href='http://www.run-greece.gr/'> Run-Greece </a>, a race series taking
place in all major cities of Greece.
This was a good opportunity for me to start training again after a long break
for 3 months, between May and August, due to the birth of my son.

I start my training around mid-August, two or three times a week. The first
four weeks were very disappointing and I was hardly running 5km with an
average pace of ~6:20/km. I didn't give up, even though I was about 5kg
heavier than last year. I knew it was a matter of time to reach some better
results, one year ago I was able to run 20+km with a steady pace of
<5:30/km with ease. I had start worrying about my decision to run the
10km race, maybe it would be smarter to go for the half distance.

After 5 weeks of training, around late September, my body start to react
on training, my feet was felt stronger, and my breath more normal, even
after 6-7 km. One week before the race, I was able to run ~8km with a
steady pace of 6:00/km. I knew I could run the distance at any time
around 1 hour or so.

On Sunday morning, although it was showering rain I was feeling great
ready to race after almost a year. I had my usual breakfast, wore my
clothes, grab my bag and headed to Patras central square. The square
was almost full of people most of them waiting to start the 10km race.

I started running quite fast, but soon I stabilized to a ~5:30/km pace,
I kept it up to the 4th km. Then I felt that I had to slow down a bit. A lot
of people pass by me until the 7th km. For the next 2 km I tried to speedup
since I was feeling quite good, this brought me to the last kilometer and I
decided to give my best. The result as measured by the chip is reported in the
<a href='http://www.run-greece.gr/index.php?option=com_joodb&view=article
&joobase=3&id=84767%3Amparekas&Itemid=136&lang=en'>
official results page</a> as 55:55.

Here is the route of the 10K race as I tracked it with my phone.

My feeling after finishing was that I could do much better. The time I
performed was the same as I have done 3 years ago in
<a href='http://www.athensclassicmarathon.org/?option=com_joodb&view=article
&joobase=7&id=1458%3A1458&Itemid=172&lang=en'>2010 Athens Classic Marathon
10K race</a>, so it seems that if I continue  training on a regular basis I
will perform much better in the upcoming
